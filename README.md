Android homework assignments from Intro to Android Development and Advanced Android Development.

## Notable Assignments
Here are some of my favorite apps:

### WeatherViewer
This is a very simple app that displays the weather for the next 7 days for the entered United States and Canadian cities. This assignment used API calls to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.com) and [Geocodio](https://www.geocod.io/) to convert the user entered city, to geographical coordinates, then return weather data for that location.
